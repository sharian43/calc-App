# calc-App
The code provided is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a basic calculator interface. 
It creates a calculator with a screen section to display input and output and a set of calculator buttons for performing calculations.

The HTML part defines the structure of the calculator using div, section, and button elements. It also includes 
a reference to an external CSS file for styling and an external JavaScript file for implementing the calculator's functionality.

The CSS code sets the styling for different elements of the calculator, such as the background, button styles, and layout. 
It uses properties like background, border, box-shadow, and font size to achieve the desired appearance.

The JavaScript code handles the logic of the calculator. It defines variables to store the running total, buffer, and previous operator.
The buttonClick function is called when a calculator button is clicked. It determines whether the clicked button represents a symbol 
(such as an operator) or a number and then calls the appropriate functions (handleSymbol or handleNumber) to handle the input.
